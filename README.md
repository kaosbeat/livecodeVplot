Live coding a Vplotter should be as easy as sendinng some commands. The very bare commands we need are

## commands
1. pen up
2. pen down
3. getCurrentPos
4. gotoXY
5. calibrate/config
6. reset

All other commands should be implemented on the livecoding side, probably a python REPL or similar, and should be macros of these commands

## serial interface
listening for G-code style commands, industry standards


## live code interface
macros for squares/cubes/circles
macros for dashed lines
